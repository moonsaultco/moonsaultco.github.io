I am going to journal my journey building a modern web template.

I'd like it to include:

* React
* React router
* Node.js backend
* Integration with a CMS
* Authentication with Mongoose/Passport and/or Stormpath
* Responive Design CSS framework using LESS or SASS
* Tight and automated developer loop using Grunt or Gulp

I am goign to chronicle all of these decisions and why I will make them. Each piece of this may not be large, but I think it will be helpfull to look at my decision making process.

At the end of this success looks likeâ€¦

* Clear documentation on how to get the application up and running
* A landing page at the root of the application
* Content from that landing page is being displayed from a CMS
* Sign up feature
* Forgot password feature
* The ability to log into the application and see a different page that displays the user email and name
* Cumber tests
* Responsive design for each of the pages.
