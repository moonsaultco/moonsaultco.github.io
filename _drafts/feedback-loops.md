Short feedback loops = AWESOME!

Long feedback loops (think days)  = Painful, but not a total waste. You can go off and do something else

Medium feedback loops = THE DEVIL’S SPAWN.  20 minute to 2 hour feedback loops.  You can’t get flow going on anything else because you are pre-occupied on waiting for your loop to complete.
