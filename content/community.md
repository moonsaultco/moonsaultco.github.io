### Community Solar

Another project for [Tendril][1]. We built [this site][2] aimed at customers of the Oklahoma Utility company OG&amp;E. It helps people interested in [community solar power][3] evaluate their savings potential. 

We built the site using designs developed by Tendril and OG&amp;E. (We only worked on the pages that are reachable without a log in.) This was a pretty quick build, about two weeks for the first version, and maybe another week for changes and polish.
