### Physician Locator

We designed and built this site for a large insurance company.


The brief was to create a tool to help insurance agents sell to a predominantly elderly population. Business rules at the insurance company organized the physicians into different groups. A doctor could belong to multiple groups, but each patient could enroll in only one. The challenge was to provide a way to visualize these networks, so the agent and customer could find a group that included the doctots the customer wanted.

The design we settled on combined a physician locator with a shopping cart. You could search for a doctor and save them. You could filter by speciality, language spoken and other physician properties. The cart page highlights the groups that saved doctors have in common, and displays a warning if there arenâ€™t any. 

The original plan for the project was to create native iOS and Android apps, but due to a tight timeline (6 weeks), we suggested a responsive web application which removed the extra time for app store approval and allowed for fast updates.
