### MyHome

Working with [Tendril][1], we were part of the team building their [MyHome][2]™ app. MyHome is a white label mobile app that allows users to interface with their bills, energy use and Tendril’s innovative [Orchestrated Energy][3] program. The app is a hybrid mobile app built using the [ionic framework][4] and we worked on a little bit of everything, from the front-end coding to backend APIs.
