### SolarPulse

Working with [Tendril][1], we built solarpulse.com, a website that educated people about rooftop solar and connected them with the right installer for their needs.

The site was equal parts educational content and lead generation. We built many different form variations, did A/B tests, and gradually improved the conversion rate of the forms.

Although the site had good traction in the marketplace, it was reliant on paid traffic and therefore was fairly expensive to run. In early 2017, the site was retired.
