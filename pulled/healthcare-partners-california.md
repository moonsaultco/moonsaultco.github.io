Healthcare Partners of California has a complex referral network that insurance brokers were having a hard time navigating.

They came to us with the idea of taking their existing information and making it easier to access for brokers. The final design we settled on was a provider search and filter experience and a user could save those providers to a “cart”. If the providers in your cart networks overlapped, that gave a clear sign which plan they should sign up with.

The original plan for the project was to create native iOS and Android apps, but due to a tight timeline (6 weeks), we suggested a responsive web application which removed the extra time for app store approval and allowed for fast updates.
