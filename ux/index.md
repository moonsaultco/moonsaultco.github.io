		I've had the great pleasure of working on John's designs at Placeable for the past year. While anyone who looks at his work can clearly tell that he is a brilliant designer with great taste, it’s what you can’t tell without spending time with him that truly sets John apart. John brings a tremendous attitude, well thought out perspective, and an uncanny ability to both defend his position and remain flexible in the face of reasonable arguments.

		John is one of those rare individuals who both knows what he’s doing and gives a damn about his job. He also happens to be a cool dude and fun to work with.
