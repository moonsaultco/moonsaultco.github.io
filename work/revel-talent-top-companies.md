Revel Talent is changing the way marketers manage their careers and how great companies find them. They help marketing professionals decide when to change jobs and help evaluate which companies are a good fit. Revel came to us with the idea to build a curated list of top companies, combining available information with research and analysis they perform.

We created a responsive application that helps marketing professionals research companies and plan their careers. The app pulls data from four sources and incorporates research done by Revel Talent staff to build a comprehensive company profile. We were involved in all phases of the project from UX Design through planning, picking technologies and building the application. Using a search based datastore, two microservices and a node.js based architecture we were able to deliver in less than a month.
