Tendril Networks provides a cloud platform for energy service providers. Tendril approached us to build an interface on one of their existing APIs.

In just over two weeks we designed and built an engaging site with two main benefits. The first, aimed at the consumer, allows you to enter an address and get usage data for a home. This helps demonstrate the accuracy of Tendril’s data and modeling. The second benefit, aimed more at energy companies, shows how using Tendril’s APIs can increase marketing conversion rates.
