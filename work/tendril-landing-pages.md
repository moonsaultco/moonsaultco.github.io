Tendril Networks provides a cloud platform for energy service providers. Tendril approached us to use their existing APIs and home energy modeling to test landing page engagement.

We created three campaigns to test the user engagement with and without Tendril data. Each campaigns was split url tested with personalized, non-personalized and generic variants.
